So far my app is only a very dumb lister for github api objects. I did not manage to finish the most important part of the app on time- the voting itself.
I am quite sure that it probably does not even qualify, because the realtime communication is not yet there.

Thank you though for organizing the event, I am glad I could at least participate.
